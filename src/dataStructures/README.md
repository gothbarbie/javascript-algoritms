# Data Structures

JavaScript doesn't inherently have support for several of the type of lists that other languages support. This is a list of such data structures implemented via JavaScript class-syntax (with Typescript).

## Singly Linked List

- Good for insertion and removal at the beginning of the list.
- Bad for searching and access.

Performance:

- Insertion - O(1)
- Removal - Removing first O(1) otherwise O(n)
- Searching - O(n)
- Access - O(n)

## Doubly Linked List

## Stack

## Queue

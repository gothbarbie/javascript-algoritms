# Sorting Algorithms

There are a bunch of different kind of sorting algorithms.
This library does not contain all of them. Some of them are
generally faster (quicksort) and some are generally slower (bubble sort) and some perform better under certain conditions.

The sorting algorithms are sorted by their type. Sometimes
there are more than one implementation.
